##  About the Project

This repository contains all the code, projects, and notes from my **Data Analytics Summer Training** at *Institute of Innovation in Technology and Management (IITM)*.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in data analysis using tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and more.
